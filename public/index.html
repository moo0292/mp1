            <p>I was born in Thailand on August 7, 1992. Although I'm Thai by nationality, my ancestors were all Chinese with the exception of my great-grandmother who was Mon. I have two siblings, an older sister and a younger brother. Growing up, my family started off poor, living outside the city. Over time, my father was able to accumulate enough money to send me to an international school and move our family into the city.<br>
            During my free time growing up, I would spend a lot of time reading books, playing video games and playing basketball and badminton. Playing video games have always been one of my biggest passions and is a big reason why I decided to study Computer Engineering in college. Another passion of mine is watching movies. I try to keep myself well-versed in the topic of films. I particularly enjoy dark comedy and epic sagas as well as the ultra-violent films (i.e. Tarantino films). Some of my other extra curricular activities also include playing the piano, joining the Varsity volleyball and badminton teams in my school, and running the annual King's marathon in Thailand.</p>
